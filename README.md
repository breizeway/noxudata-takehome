# NoxuData Takehome

Take home assignment from NoxuData

## Instructions

This should take no longer than 3 hours to complete, and you’ll have 3 days from today to complete this exercise (if this isn’t feasible, please let us know and we can try to be flexible).

The following Figma contains a part of the design that we received from our designers and have already built into our product: http://figma.com/file/KCPP1Ipte1N7trYLNJQsdC/FE-Interview?type=design&node-id=0

We’d like you to develop this Figma file:
Using NextJs (app router), Typescript and Tailwind
None of the buttons needs to functional, this is an exercise to see how well you can develop according to Figma and how you would design the components

Please respond with a public GitHub repo link once you are done. Let me know if you have any questions!

## About

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
